I have chosen kyiv which is a capital city of Ukraine. It is the largest city of the country with population about 2,847,200. Recently, Vitali Klitschko, former world boxing champion was elected as a Mayor and Head of City State Administration.

I was born in this city and want to make a contribution to the OpenStreetMap project using my knowledge and such opportunity.


coordinates of city are: 50°27?00?N 30°31?24?E
